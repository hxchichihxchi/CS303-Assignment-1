# Running the Program
1) Download and open the code in an IDE.
2) Follow the prompts as directed. This program sequentially interacts with an array in the order of this document. The program will close after the user goes through all of the prompts and procedures.

# Checking for Number in Array
The first prompt requests the user to input an integer. The program will then look through the array and see if the inputted value is included. 

If the user inputs something other than an integer or number that is not included in the array, the program will display an "error" for the corresponding reason. It will reprompt the user to input a new value until it recieves a valid integer that is in the array.

If the number is in the array, the program will display the index value that the number is located in the array.

# Modifying a Number
The user will now need to input a valid integer that represents an index value. Once a valid input has been made, the user will be prompted to submit an integer which will replace whatever number is associated with the inputted index value.

The program will then print out the modified array.

# Adding a Number
The user will now input any integer to add to the end of the array. If anything other than an integer is inputted, it will give the corresponding error and reprompt the user to input a different value until a valid input is made.

# Replacing a Number With 0
The user will be prompted to enter a valid integer number that represents as an index value. The program will replace the number at that index value with 0. Upon a valid input, the program will display the new array.

Upon Finishing, the program will stop and "close."
